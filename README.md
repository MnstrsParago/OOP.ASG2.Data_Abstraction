# Airline Reservation System

**Subject:** Object-Oriented Programming  
**Assignment 2:** Data Abstraction  
**Student:** Ayazbek Abdanur

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project implements a simple Airline Reservation System using core OOP concepts in Java. It demonstrates the principles of **data abstraction** by modeling three main entities:
- `Flight`
- `Passenger`
- `Reservation`

Each class encapsulates relevant attributes and behaviors, enabling clear object interaction and system logic.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Book a seat on a flight.
- Link reservations between a flight and a passenger.
- Display detailed information about flights, passengers, and reservations.
- Check equality between different flight instances (based on `.equals()`).

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies

- Language: Java
- IDE: IntelliJ IDEA
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

## ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Abstraction**: Classes expose only the necessary interface.
- **Encapsulation**: All data is kept private and accessed through methods.
- **Class composition**: Reservation is composed of a Flight and a Passenger.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OOP.ASG2.Data_Abstraction.git
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or any IDE of your choice).

3. Run Main.java.

ðŸ“˜ Reflection
This project was developed as part of the OOP. I enjoyed modeling real-world systems and applying theoretical concepts into working code. Although I found the experience valuable and the structure of the code quite solid from my current perspective.
